# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Designing path-protection based scheme to prevent traffic disruptions from single-link failures. Developing and implementing new algorithms; an improvement over existing algorithms like streams, gives more savings in terms of network resources in dynamic environment. Heuristic gave near-optimal results for networks like USANET, NSFNET."
