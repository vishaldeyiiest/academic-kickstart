I led several sessions for juniors through the Robotics club, organized lectures on competitive coding. 
I was selected as the head of Turing Chapter of the Coding club at our esteemed university and worked hard to make seemingly tough and humongous domain of machine learning tractable. Also, I was an intern at a company GradeUp as content developer, I was assigned to set Q&A and mock tests on core CS subjects.
