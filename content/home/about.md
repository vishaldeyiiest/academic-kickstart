# Biography

I'm a final year student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in the Department of Computer Science and Technology of Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India. I have already authored three journal publications by 2018 (published by SCI Springer and Taylor & Francis), a conference paper (published by ACM Digital Library) and another conference paper (accepted in upcoming IEEE conference). I completed one summer internship of 2 months duration in 2017 under NTU-India Connect Program of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research interests primarily include machine learning, design of algorithms related to data science and networking problems.
